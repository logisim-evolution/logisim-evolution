        Using JAR libraries
      </h2>
      <p>
        Logisim has two types of circuit components: those that are designed within Logisim as combinations of components, and those primitive components that are written in Java. Logisim circuits are easier to design, but they cannot support sophisticated user interaction, and they are relatively inefficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Logisim contains a fairly thorough collection of built-in libraries of Java components, but it can also load additional libraries written by you or others. Once you have downloaded a library, you can import it into your project by right-clicking the project in the explorer pane (the top line) and choosing Load Library &gt; JAR Library.... Then, Logisim will prompt you to select the JAR file. (In some circumstances, you may have to type the starting class name when prompted, which would be provided by the library developer. However, a developer typically configures the JAR library to avoid this (by including a <q>manifest</q> file in the JAR with a Library-Class attribute specifying the main class name).)
      </p>
      <h2>
        Creating JAR libraries
      </h2>
      <p>
        The remainder of this section is dedicated to a series of thoroughly commented examples illustrating how to develop Logisim libraries yourself. You should only attempt this if you're an experienced Java programmer. You will find the documentation beyond these examples fairly meager.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can download a JAR file that allows these examples to be imported into Logisim via the Logisim Web site's Links section. That JAR file also contains the source code contained in these examples.

            Illustrates the essential components of any component type using a simple example of a component that takes a multibit input and computes the next Gray code value following it.

          <p>
            Illustrates how to define a library. This is the entry point for any JAR file - the class whose name the user enters when loading the JAR library.

        <dd>
          <p>
            Illustrates how to make a component that has internal state, in particular an 8-bit counter that iterates through Gray codes.

          <p>
            Demonstrates a complete, fairly sophisticated component with which the user can interact. It implements a Gray code counter where the number of bits remembered is customizable, and where the user can edit the current value by clicking on it with the Poke Tool and typing a value.
