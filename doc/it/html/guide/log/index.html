<p>To understand or debug a circuit it is often very useful to be able to observe the different signals in a visual way. This is the purpose of the timeline. This module allows the recording of signals in graphical form or in a table of value in a text file.</p>

<p>You can enter the logging module via the menu  <b class=menu>|&nbsp;Simulate&nbsp;|</b>&rarr;<b class=menu>|&nbsp;Chronogram&nbsp;|</b>.  It brings up the signal selection window.</p>
<p>The circuit below is an illustrative example for the timing module.<br>

<p>These are the clocks that serve as a driver for displaying signals. The simulation knows two particular clocks. One is imperative and named <var> sysclk </var> and another optional and secondary named <var> clk </var></p>
<p><b class=note>Note:</b> it is imperative that a clock named <var> sysclk </var> appears in your circuit. It will be used as a time base by the chronogram module. It does not have to be connected to your circuit. It is in principle the fastest and is set to a duty cycle 1/1 tic.<p>
