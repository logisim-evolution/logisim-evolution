<h1>Fehler durch Oszillationen</h1>

<p>The propagation algorithm, which normally works silently without any
problems, will become very visible
when you create a circuit that oscillates.</p>

<p>This circuit is currently in a stable condition. But if you change the
input to 1, the circuit will effectively enter an infinite loop. After
a while, Logisim will simply give up and show an "Oscillation apparent" message
telling you that it believes that the circuit is oscillating.</p>

<p>It will display the values it has at the time it gives up. These values
will look wrong - in this screen shot, the AND gate is emitting 1
although one of its inputs is 0, but it could be that the NOT gate
has a 1 input and a 1 output.</p>

<p>Logisim helpfully circles in red each location that seems to be
involved in the oscillation. If an involved point lies within a
subcircuit, Logisim will draw that subcircuit's outline in red.</p>

<p>When Logisim detects oscillation, it shuts down all
further simulation. You can re-enable simulation using the
Simulate menu's Simulation Enabled option.</p>

<p>Logisim detects oscillation using a fairly simple technique: If the
circuit simulation seems to many iterations, then it will simply give up
and report oscillation. (The points it identifies as being involved are
those that were touched in the last 25% of the iterations.)
Thus, it could erroneously report oscillation,
particularly if you are working with an exceptionally large circuit; but
it would be one that is larger than any I have built using Logisim.
In any case, if you are confident that the reporting is in error, you
can configure the number of iterations
completed before oscillation occurs via the
<a href="../opts/index.html">Project Options</a> window's
<a href="../opts/simulate.html">Simulation tab</a>.</p>
