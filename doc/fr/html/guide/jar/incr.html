        Each component included in a library is defined by creating a subclass of <code>InstanceFactory</code> found in the <code>com.cburch.logisim.instance</code> package. This subclass has all the code involved
      </p>
      <p>
        (Here we're describing the API for the current version of Logisim. You may find some libraries developed for older versions of Logisim, in which components were developed by defining two classes, one extending <code>Component</code> and another extending <code>ComponentFactory</code>. Version 2.3.0 introduced the much simpler <code>InstanceFactory</code> API; the older technique is deprecated.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Three Logisim packages define most of the classes relevant to defining component libraries.

        About Gray codes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Before we go on, let me briefly describe the Gray code on which these examples are based. It's not really important to understanding how these examples work, so you can safely skip to the code below if you wish - particularly if you already know Gray codes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gray code is a technique (named after Frank Gray) for iterating through <var>n</var>-bit sequences with only one bit changed for each step. As an example, consider the 4-bit Gray code listed below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each value has the bit underlined that will change for the next value in the sequence. For example, after 0000 comes 0001, in which the final bit has been toggled, so the final bit is underlined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Logisim's built-in components don't include anything working with Gray codes. But electronics designers find Gray codes useful sometimes. One particularly notable instance of Gray codes is along the axes in Karnaugh maps.

      <h2>
        GrayIncrementer
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a minimal example illustrating the essential elements to defining a component. This particular component is an incrementer, which takes an multibit input and produces the next Gray code following it in sequence.

        This example by itself is not enough to create a working JAR file; you must also provide a Library class, as illustrated on the next page.
