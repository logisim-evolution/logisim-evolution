        <h1>Configuring Questa Advanced Simulator</h1>

        <p>Questa Advanced Simulator can be optionally used to validate VHDL
           entities, and is required for any simulation using a VHDL entity.
        </p>

        <p>By default, the VHDL validation with Questa Advanced Simulator is
           disabled. In order to active it, you need to go in the <i>Window</i>
           menu, <i>Perferences</i> and then in the <i>Third Party Softwares</i>
           tab. You can then enable the validation by clicking on the <i>Use
           Questa Advanced Simulator to validate VHDL entities</i> checkbox.
        </p>

        <center><img src="../../../img-guide/hdl-ip-questa.png" /></center>
        
        <p>Right below that option, you can also set the path to your Questa
           Advanced Simulator installation directory. In order to do so, simply
           click the <i>Browse...</i> button and select the corresponding
           directory. If you activate the validation but do not set the path,
           you will be prompted to select it the next time a VHDL validation
           occurs.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will also be prompted for the path if you
           try to run a simulation of a circuit that includes a VHDL entity.
