<h1>Generating a circuit</h1>

<p>The <b class=button>Build Circuit</b> button will construct a circuit whose gates correspond to the currently chosen expressions for each output. The circuit's inputs and outputs will be displayed in top-down order corresponding to how they appear under the Inputs and Outputs tabs. Generally speaking, the constructed circuit will be attractive; and, indeed, one application of Logisim's Combinational Analysis module is to beautify poorly drawn circuits. Still, as with any automatic formatting, it will not express the structural details that a human-drawn circuit would.</p>

<p>When you click the <b class=button>Build Circuit</b> button, a dialog box will appear prompting you to choose which project where you want the circuit and the name you wish to give it.</p>

<center><img src="../../../img-guide/analyze-build.png"></center>

<p>If you type the name of an existing circuit, then that circuit will be replaced (after Logisim prompts you to confirm that you really want to do this).</p>

<p>The <b class=propertie>Build Circuit</b> dialog includes two options. 
<ul><li>The <b>Use Two-Input Gates Only</b> option specifies that you want all gates constructed to have two inputs.  (NOT gates, of course, constitute an exception to this rule.)</li>
<li> The <b>Use NAND Gates Only</b> option specifies that you would like it to translate the circuit into one using only NAND gates. You can select both options if you want to use only two-input NAND gates.</li></ul></p>

<p>Logisim cannot construct a NAND-only circuit for an expression containing any XOR operators. This option will therefore be disabled if any outputs' expressions contain XORs.</p>
