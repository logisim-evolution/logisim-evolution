<h1>The Selection tab</h1>

<p>The Selection tab allows you to select which values
should be included in the log. The window below corresponds to the
following circuit.

<p>The tab is divided into three vertical areas. The first (leftmost) is
a list of all components in the circuit whose values can be logged.
Among the built-in libraries, the following types of components support
logging.
<blockquote>
Wiring library: Pin, Probe, and Clock components<br>
I/O library: Button and LED components<br>
Memory library: All components except ROM
</blockquote>
For components which have labels associated with them, their names correspond
to the labels; other components' names specify their type and their
location within the circuit.
Any subcircuits will also appear in the list; they cannot be selected
for logging, but eligible components within them can be.
Note that the RAM component requires you to choose which memory
address(es) should be logged; it allows logging only for the first 256
addresses.</p>

<p>The last (rightmost) vertical area lists those components that have
been selected. Also, it indicates the radix (base) in which the
component's multi-bit values
will be logged; the radix does not have a significant effect on one-bit
values.</p>

<p>The middle column of buttons allows the manipulation of the items
within the selection.
<ul>

<li><strong>Add</strong> adds the currently selected item(s) on the left
side into the selection.

<li><strong>Change Radix</strong> cycles the radix for the currently
selected component in the selection between 2 (binary), 10 (decimal),
and 16 (hexadecimal).

<li><strong>Move Up</strong> moves the currently selected component in
the selection forward one spot.

<li><strong>Move Down</strong> moves the currently selected component in
the selection back one spot.

<li><strong>Remove</strong> removes the currently selected component in
the selection.

</ul></p>
