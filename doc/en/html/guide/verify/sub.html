        Now suppose we have two Logisim circuits that are supposed to do the same thing. As an instructor, you might have had students complete an assignment: You have one file containing your solution, but you have several student files containing their work. Maybe the assignment was to build a two-bit adder.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll imagine that we have two files, named <tt><b>master.circ</b></tt> and <tt><b>query.circ</b></tt>. Each file contains a circuit named <b class="propertie">Adder2</b> (it's important that the circuit to test be named exactly the same), whose appearance is the following.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <tt>Adder2 in master.circ</tt>
              </td>
              <td>
                <tt>Adder2 in query.circ</tt>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="../../../../img-guide/verify-adder-master.png" alt="#########">
              </td>
              <td>
                <img src="../../../../img-guide/verify-adder-query.png" alt="#########">
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        As you can see, the master circuit uses Logisim's built-in adder, while the query circuit uses two subcircuits representing a half adder and a full adder (which themselves are built up of simple gates). For the purpose of our example, the query circuit has a stupid error: The <var>carry</var> from the half adder is not connected into the full adder.
      </p>
      <p>
        We build our testing circuit into a different file <tt>test.circ</tt>. There, we load <tt><b>master.circ</b></tt> as a Logisim Library <b class="menu">|&nbsp;Project&nbsp;|</b>→<b class="menu">|&nbsp;Load Library&nbsp;|</b>→ <b class="menu">|&nbsp;Logisim Library&nbsp;|</b>, and we insert its 2-bit adder as a subcircuit. We could execute this circuit directly to get the desired output for a perfect solution.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
	   <div class="forcode">
        <tt>java -jar logisim-evolution.jar test.circ -tty table</tt>
		</div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        But we want to execute the circuit using <tt><b>query.circ</b></tt> rather than <tt><b>master.circ</b></tt> as the loaded library. The naive approach would be to open Logisim and load that library instead; or you might simply remove the <tt><b>master.circ</b></tt> file and rename <tt><b>query.circ</b></tt> to be named <tt><b>master.circ</b></tt> instead. But Logisim includes a handy <b calls="porpertie"><tt>-sub</tt></b> option that temporarily replace one file by another during that session — without making any changes on disk.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
	   <div class="forcode">
        <tt>java -jar logisim-evolution.jar test.circ -tty table -sub master.circ query.circ</tt>
		</div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The output you would see from this is shown below; it is of course different from what we saw in <a href="index.html">the previous section</a> because the library common to <tt>adder2</tt> has been replaced in the test circuit by that of <tt>query.circ</tt> erroneous.
