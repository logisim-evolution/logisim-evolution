<h1>Value propagation</h1>

<p>Logisim's algorithm for simulating the propagation of values through circuits is not something that you normally need to worry about. Suffice it to say that the algorithm is sophisticated enough to account for gate delays, but not realistic enough to account for more difficult phenomena like varying voltages or race conditions.</p>

<p>Do you still want to know more?
