       By default, when a subcircuit is placed within a larger circuit, it is drawn as a rectangle with a notch indicating the north end of the subcircuit's layout. Pins will be placed on the rectangle's border based on their facing: Pins that face east in the layout (and typically appear on the west side of the layout) will be placed on the rectangle's west side, according to their top-down ordering in the layout. Pins that face south in the layout (typically toward the north side of the layout) will be placed on the rectangle's north side, according to the left-to-right ordering in the layout.

	  The default rectangle can optionally include some letters that will appear in the middle of the rectangle. To specify this, select the selection tool (<img class="intxt" src="../../../../icons/select.gif" alt="#########">) and click the background of the circuit's layout. This will show the circuit attributes in the attribute table, including the Shared Label, Shared Label Facing, and Shared Label Font attributes. The value of the Shared Label attribute will be drawn in the rectangle's center; the Shared Label Facing attribute customizes which direction the text is drawn, and of course the Shared Label Font attribute customizes the font used.
