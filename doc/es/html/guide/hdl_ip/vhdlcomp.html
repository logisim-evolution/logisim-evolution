        <h1>VHDL Entity</h1>

        <p>A VHDL entity is a component that can be described using VHDL. It
           comes with an editor which can be used to edit the entity and to
           validate it, providing you have Questa Advanced Simulator installed
           on your system.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating a VHDL entity</h2>
        
        <p>To create a new VHDL entity, simply open the <i>HDL IP</i> library in
           the <i>explorer panel</i> and click on the <i>VHDL Entity</i>
           component. If the library is not available, you will need to load it:
           go to the <i>Project</i> menu, <i>Load Library</i> then <i>Build-in
           Library</i> and select <i>HDL IP</i> from the menu.
        </p>

        <h2>Editing a VHDL entity</h2>
        
        <center><img class=notscal  src="../../../img-guide/hdl-ip-symbol.png" /></center>
        
        <p>A new VHDL entity comes with a default template which contains two
           inputs and two outputs. The entity can be edited by clicking on the
           content attribute, as shown below.
        </p>
        
        <center><img class=notscal  src="../../../img-guide/hdl-ip-properties.png" /></center>
        
        <p>The integrated HDL editor can then be used to modify the entity using
           VHDL directly. You can also import the content of a VHDL file by
           clicking the <i>Import...</i> button, or export your own code by
           clicking the <i>Export...</i> button.
        </p>

        <center><img src="../../../img-guide/hdl-ip-editor.png" /></center>
        
        <p>As you edit your component, the <i>Validate Content</i> button will
           light up. It can be used to check if your code is valid, as long as
           you have Questa Advanced Simulator installed and configured (see
           <a href="questa.html">Configuring Questa Advanced Simulator</a> for
           more information). If it is the case, clicking the <i>Validate</i>
           button will compile the VHDL code, check for errors and display a
           window with more information if any is found. If your code is valid,
           the button will simply be deactivated until you make further
           modifications.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't have Questa Advanced Simulator,
           or if it is disabled, Logisim will nonetheless make a few checks,
           mostly on the ports description.
        </p>
        
        <p>When you are done editing your entity, you can click the <i>Close
           Window</i> button. The code will be validated by Questa Advanced
           Simulator if it is installed and enabled, and Logisim will
           automatically regenerate your entity's symbol, adding, removing or
           updating any port you might have added, removed or changed in your
           code. If an error occurs during the validation process, a window
           containing more information will be displayed, and you will be given
           three choices:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Close anyway and <strong>discard all modifications</strong>.
                This is achieved by clicking <i>Yes</i>. Please note any changes
                done to your entity will be <strong>permanently lost</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Go back to the editor and correct the error(s). This is achieved
                by clicking <i>No</i>.
            </li>
            <li>Create a backup of your VHDL code and close the editor. This is
                achieved by clicking the <i>Create backup</i> button, and then
                by selecting a folder and a name for your backup file.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Using a VHDL entity</h2>
        
        <p>A VHDL entity is used like any other component. The only notable
           difference is how the entities are handled in the simulation. Please
           see <a href="simulation.html">VHDL simulator</a> for a detailed
           explanation.
