        <h1>Simulating test benchs</h1>
        
        <p>You can add a test bench to your circuit to test it, but you have to 
           consider the following restrictions due to the simulation 
           architecture.
        </p>

        <h2>Simulation must be driven by Logisim</h2>
        
        <p>You cannot add event generating elements to your test bench, for
            example, you cannot add a clock generator process. Your test bench
            must take an external clock from Logisim as input.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Don't use time based conditions</h2>
        
        <p>The time representation does not exist in Logisim, no you cannot have
           event based on time, for example <i>wait for 5 ns</i>. If you want to
           make asynchronous verification, you must add a <i>sysclk</i> who has 
           at least twice the frequency of the mainclk. This way, you will be 
           able to check the signals not only on the main clock rising edges but
           at any time you need.
