<h1>Substituting libraries</h1>

<p>Now suppose we have two Logisim circuits that are supposed to do the same thing.
As an instructor, you might have had students complete an assignment:
You have one file containing your solution, but you have several student files
containing their work. Maybe the assignment was to build a two-bit adder.</p>

<p>I'll imagine that we have two files, named <tt>adder-master.circ</tt>
and <tt>adder-query.circ</tt>. Each file contains a circuit named
<q>2-bit adder</q> (it's important that the circuit to test be named exactly the same),
whose appearance is the following.</p>

<blockquote><table><tbody>
<tr><td><tt>adder-master.circ</tt></td>
    <td><tt>adder-query.circ</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="../../../../en/img-guide/verify-adder-master.png" width="184" height="63"></td>
    <td><img src="../../../../en/img-guide/verify-adder-query.png" width="171" height="112"></td></tr>
</tbody></table></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the master circuit uses Logisim's built-in adder, 
while the query circuit uses two subcircuits representing a half adder and
a full adder (which themselves are built up of simple gates).
For the purpose of our example, the query circuit has a stupid error:
The carry from the half adder is not connected into the full adder.</p>

<p>We build our testing circuit into a different file. There, we load
<tt>adder-master.circ</tt> as a Logisim Library
(Project &gt; Load Library &gt; Logisim Library&hellip;), and we insert its
2-bit adder as a subcircuit. We could execute this circuit directly to get
the desired output for a perfect solution.</p>

<blockquote><tt>java&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;logisim-filename.jar&nbsp;adder-test.circ&nbsp;-tty&nbsp;table</tt></blockquote>

<p>But we want to execute the circuit using <tt>adder-query.circ</tt>
rather than <tt>adder-master.circ</tt> as the loaded library.
The naive approach would be to open Logisim and load that library instead;
or you might simply remove the <tt>adder-master.circ</tt> file and rename
<tt>adder-query.circ</tt> to be named <tt>adder-master.circ</tt> instead.
But Logisim includes a handy <q><tt>-sub</tt></q> option that temporarily replace
one file by another during that session &mdash; without making any changes on disk.</p>

<blockquote><tt>java&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;logisim-filename.jar&nbsp;adder-test.circ&nbsp;-tty&nbsp;table&nbsp;-sub&nbsp;adder-master.circ&nbsp;adder-query.circ</tt></blockquote>

<p>The output you would see from this is shown below; it is of course different
from what we saw in <a href="index.html">the previous section</a> since now it is
executing using the erroneous <tt>adder-query.circ</tt>.</p>
