<h1>Logging</h1>

<p>In testing a large circuit, and for documenting a circuit's
behavior, a log of past circuit behavior can be useful. This is the purpose for
Logisim's logging module, which allows you to select components whose
values should be logged; optionally, you can specify a file into which
the log should be placed.</p>

<p>You can enter the logging module via the Logging...
option from the Simulate menu. It brings up a window with three tabs.</p>
<center><img src="../../../../en/img-guide/log-selection.png" width="466" height="387"></center>
<p>We will discuss each of these tabs separately.</p>
<blockquote>
	<a href="selection.html">The Selection tab</a>
	<br><a href="table.html">The Table tab</a>
	<br><a href="file.html">The File tab</a>
</blockquote></p>

<p>Each project has only one logging window; when you switch to viewing
another circuit within the project, the logging window switches
automatically to logging the other circuit instead. That is, it does
this unless you are <a href="../subcirc/debug.html">moving up or down
within the same simulation</a>, in which case the logging module does
not change.</p>

<p>Note that when the logging module switches to logging another
simulation, it will cease any logging into a file. Should you switch
back to the simulation again, it will remember the configuration for
that simulation, but you will need to re-enable the file logging
manually.</p>
