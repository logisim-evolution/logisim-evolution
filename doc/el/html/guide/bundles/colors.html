<h1>Wire colors</h1>

<p>We are now in a position to summarize the full rainbow of
colors that Logisim wires can take on. The following
little circuit illustrates all of them at once.</p>
<center><img src="../../../../en/img-guide/bundles-colors.png" width="131" height="195"></center>

<ul>

<li><p><strong>Gray:</strong> The wire's bit width is unknown. This
occurs because the wire is not attached to any components' inputs
and outputs. (All inputs and outputs have a defined bit width.)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Blue:</strong> The wire carries a one-bit
value, but nothing is driving a specific value onto the wire.
We call this a <em>floating</em> bit; some people call it a
<em>high-impedance</em> value.
In this example, the component placing a value onto the wire is a three-state
pin, so it can emit this floating value.</p>

<li><p><strong>Dark green:</strong> The wire is carrying a one-bit 0
value.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Bright green:</strong> The wire is carrying a one-bit 1
value.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Black:</strong> The wire is carrying a multi-bit value.
Some or all of the bits may not be specified.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Red:</strong> The wire is carrying an error value.
This often arises because a gate cannot determine the proper output,
perhaps because it has no inputs. It could also arise because two components
are trying to send different values onto the wire;
this is what happens in the above example,
where one input pin places 0 onto the wire
while another places 1 onto the same wire, causing a conflict.
Multi-bit wires will turn red when any of the bits carried are error values.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Orange:</strong> The components attached to the wire do
not agree in bit width. An orange wire is effectively "broken": It does
not carry values between components. Here, we've attached a two-bit
component to a one-bit component, so they are incompatible.</p></li>

</ul>
