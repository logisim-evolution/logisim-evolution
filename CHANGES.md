## [3.7.2] - 2021-11-09

## Changed

- You can now swap the placement of main canvas and component tree/properties pane.

### Fixed

- Fixed Preferences/Window "Reset window layout to defaults" not doing much.
- Fixed Gradle builder failing to compile LSe if sources were not checked out from Git.

## [3.7.1] - 2021-10-21

### Added

- Logisim has now an internal font-chooser to comply to the font-values used.

### Fixed

- Several bug fixes.

## [3.7.0] - 2021-10-12

  - All long arguments require `--` prefix i.e. `--version`,
  - All short arguments require single `-` as prefix i.e. `-v`,
  - `-clearprefs` is now `--clear-prefs`,
  - `-clearprops` option is removed (use `--clear-prefs` instead),

- Augmented direction verbal labels (East, North, etc), with corresponding arrow symbols.
- Application title string now adds app name/version at the very end of the title.
- Canvas Zoom controls new offer wider range of zoom and three level of granularity.
- Project's "Dirty" (unsaved) state is now also reflected by adding `*` marker to the window title.
- Replace DarkLaf with FlatLaf for better compatibility.
- Display "Too few inputs for table" if Karnaugh Map has only 1 input.
- Improved partial placement on FPGA-boards for multi-pin components.
- HexDisplay is stays blank if no valid data is fed instead of showing "H" (#365).
- Combined `Select Location` from Plexers and `Gate Location` from Wiring to one attribute.
  - Breaks backwards comparability for Transistors and Transmission Gates.
