Logisim-evolution logo project
Designed by Marcin Orlowski <http://MarcinOrlowski.com>

* `logisim-evolution-logo-src.svg` - main logo project file
* 'logisim-evolution-logo.svg` - derrived from main project file with all texts converted to paths.

NOTE: to properly render `logisim-evolution-logo-src.svg` (be it in-app, on webpage etc) you must
have all the used fonts installed on target machine or your renderer/browser substitute fonts
producing wrong image. Alternatively you can either render your image a bitmap (i.e. PNG) or
convert all texts to paths (Inkscape: "Object" menu -> "Object to Path"). We provide such version
of logo SVG as `logisim-evolution-logo.svg`.

The in-app PNG rendition of the logo (in [src/main/resources/resources/logisim/img/logisim-evolution-logo.png](../src/main/resources/resources/logisim/img/logisim-evolution-logo.png)
must be rendered as image of 200px height and proportional width (but less than 600px)
or [About.java](../src/main/java/com/cburch/logisim/gui/start/About.java) consts needs to be adjusted.

Fonts used:
* [Electronic Circuit](https://textfonts.net/electronic-circuit-font.html)
* [A Dripping Marker](https://www.1001freefonts.com/a-dripping-marker.font) by Wick van den Belt.
