## Features ##

`Logisim-evolution` is an completely free and [open-source](https://github.com/logisim-evolution) educational, cross-platform
software for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.

Project highlights:

* easy to use circuit designer,
* logic circuit simulations,
* chronogram (to see the evolution of signals in your circuit),
* electronic board integration - schematics can now be simulated on real hardware,
* VHDL components (components whose behavior is specified in VHDL!),
* TCL/TK console (interfaces between the circuit and the user),
* huge library of components (LEDs, TTLs, switches, SoCs),
* Supports [multiple languages](docs/docs.md#translations),
* and more!
