## Features ##

`Logisim-evolution` is educational software for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
`Logisim-evolution` is [free](#license), [open-source](https://github.com/logisim-evolution), and [cross-platform](#requirements).

Project highlights:

* easy to use circuit designer,
* logic circuit simulations,
* chronogram (to see the evolution of signals in your circuit),
* electronic board integration (schematics can be simulated on real hardware),
* VHDL components (components behavior can be specified in VHDL!),
* TCL/TK console (interfaces between the circuit and the user),
* huge library of components (LEDs, TTLs, switches, SoCs),
* supports [multiple languages](docs/docs.md#translations),
* and more!

It requires [Java 11 (or newer)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

## Download ###

`Logisim-evolution` is available for
[download in compiled form](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases)
with ready to use installable packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux
or in [source code form](https://github.com/logisim-evolution), which you can [build yourself](docs/developers.md).

The following [platform specific packages](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases)
include the Java runtime and do not require it to be installed separately:

* `logisim-evolution_<version>-1_amd64.deb`: Debian package (also suitable for Ubuntu and derivatives),
* `logisim-evolution-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm`: Package for Fedora/Redhat/CentOS/SuSE Linux distributions,
* `logisim-evolution-<version>.msi`: Installer package for Microsoft Windows,
