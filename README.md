Branch master : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reds-heig/logisim-evolution.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reds-heig/logisim-evolution)

Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
It has been originally created by [Dr. Carl Burch](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and actively developed until 2011.
After this date the author focused on other projects, and recently the development has been officially stopped  [(see his message here)](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/retire-note.html).

In the meantime, people from a group of swiss institutes ([Haute École Spécialisée Bernoise](http://www.bfh.ch), [Haute École du paysage, d'ingénierie et d'architecture de Genève](http://hepia.hesge.ch), and [Haute École d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud](http://www.heig-vd.ch)) started developing a version of Logisim that fitted their courses, integrating several tools -- for instance a chronogram, the possibility to test the schematics directly on an electronic board, TCL/TK consoles, ...

The project is currently maintained by the [REDS Institute](http://reds.heig-vd.ch), which is part of the [Haute École d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud](http://www.heig-vd.ch), Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.

We have decided to release this new Logisim version under the name logisim-evolution, to highlight the large number of changes that occurred in these years, and **we actively seek the contribution of the community**.

## Other Logisim forks available on the net
* Logisim by Joseph Lawrance et al. [(link)](https://github.com/lawrancej/logisim) - they have started from Burch's original code and integrated it in several open-source development frameworks, cleaning up the code. We have taken a few code cleanups and the redo functionality from their code.
* logisim-iitd [(link)](https://code.google.com/p/logisim-iitd) - IIT Delhi version of Logisim, it integrates the Floating-Point Components within the Arithmetic Unit.
* Logisim for the CS3410 course, Cornell's University [(link)](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2015sp/) - they have a very interesting test vector feature, that was only recently integrated into logisim-evolution.

## Alternatives
* A complete rewriting of Logisim, called Digital, has been developed by Prof. Helmut Neemann of the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University Mosbach. You can find it [(here)](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).
