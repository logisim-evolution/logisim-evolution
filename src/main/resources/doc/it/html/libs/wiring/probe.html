<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>A probe is an element that simply displays the value at a given point
in a circuit. It does not itself interact with other components.</p>

<p>In most respects, the probe component duplicates the functionality
found in a <a href="pin.html">Pin component</a> configured as an output
pin. The primary difference is that if the circuit is used as a subcircuit
component, then an output pin will be a part of that interface, whereas
a probe is not. They also are different in that the probe does not have a Data Bits
attribute to be configured: The bit width is inferred from whatever value it
happens to see on its input. Graphically, they are similar but have slightly
different borders: A pin has a thick, black border, whereas a probe has
a thin, gray border.</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<p>A probe component has only one pin, which will acts as an input to
the probe. The width that this pin accepts is adaptive: The probe will
adapt to inputs of any width.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
the arrow keys alter its <q>Facing</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Facing</dt>
<dd>The side of the component where its input pin should be.</dd>

<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>The text within the label associated with the component.</dd>

<dt>Label Location</dt>
<dd>The location of the label relative to the component.</dd>

<dt>Label Font</dt>
<dd>The font with which to render the label.</dd>

<dt>Radix</dt>
<dd>The base (for example, binary, decimal, or hexadecimal) in which
a value is displayed.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Poke Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>None.</p>

<h2>Text Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>Allows the label associated with the component to be edited.</p>
