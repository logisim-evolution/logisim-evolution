<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The splitter creates a correspondence between a multi-bit value and several
separate subsets of those bits. Despite its name, it can either
split a multi-bit value into component parts, or it can combine
component parts into a multi-bit value - or indeed it can do both at once.
A more complete description of splitters is found in the `<a
href="../../guide/bundles/splitting.html">Splitters</a>' section of the
<em>User's Guide</em>.</p>

<p>Logisim treats splitters specially when propagating values within a
circuit: Whereas all other components have a computed delay for purposes
of simulating their behavior, values propagate through splitters (as
well as wires) instantaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The term <em>splitter</em> is a non-standard
term, which is unique to Logisim as far as I know. I am unaware of any
standard term for such a concept; the only term I have heard used is
<em>bus ripper</em>, but this term is unnecessarily violent for my
tastes.</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<p>To distinguish the several connecting points for a splitter, we refer
to the single connecting point one side as its <em>combined end</em>,
and we refer to the multiple connecting points on the other side as its
<em>split ends</em>.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Combined end (input/output bit width matches Bit Width In attribute)
<dd>A value holding all of the bits traveling through the splitter.

<dt>Split ends (input/output, bit width computed based on Bit <var>x</var> attributes)
<dd>The number of split ends is specified in the Fan Out attribute, and
each split end has an index that is at least 0 and less than the Fan Out
attribute. For each split end, all bits for which Bit <var>x</var>
refers to its index travels through that split end; the order of these
bits is the same as their order within the combined end.

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
the digits '0' through '9' alter its <q>Fan Out</q> attribute,
Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter both the <q>Fan Out</q> and <q>Bit Width In</q> attributes,
and the arrow keys alter its <q>Facing</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Facing</dt>
<dd><p>The location of the split ends relative to the combined end.</p></dd>

<dt>Fan Out</dt>
<dd><p>The number of split ends.</p></dd>

<dt>Bit Width In</dt>
<dd><p>The bit width of the combined end.</p></dd>

<dt>Appearance</dt>
<dd><p>Supports different ways of depicting the splitter in the circuit.
The <q>Left-handed</q> option (the default) draws a spine going left from the
combined end, with a labeled line coming from the spine for each split end.
The <q>Right-handed</q> option is the same except the spine goes right (if you're
facing according to the Facing attribute).
The <q>Centered</q> option centers the spine so it goes in roughly equal directions
left and right.
And the <q>Legacy</q> option draws diagonal lines to each split end, without labels;
this option is primarily for compatibility with versions
older than 2.7.0, when this was the only option for splitter appearance.</p></dd>

<dt>Bit <var>x</var></dt>
<dd><p>The index of the split end to which bit <var>x</var> of the combined
end corresponds. The split ends are indexed starting from 0 at the top
(for a splitter facing east or west) or from 0 at the left/west (for a
splitter facing north or south). A bit can be specified to correspond to
none of the split ends. There is no way for a bit to correspond to
multiple split ends.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can avoid twiddling each individual Bit <var>x</var> attribute
by bringing up the pop-up menu for a splitter (usually by right-clicking or
control-clicking it). The pop-up menu includes options labeled Distribute Ascending
and Distribute Descending. The Distribute Ascending option distributes the bits
so that each split end receives the same number of bits, starting from end 0.
(If the number of split ends doesn't divide exactly into the number of bits,
then the bits are distributed as evenly as possible.)
Distribute Descending does the same but starts from the highest-numbered end.</p></dd>
