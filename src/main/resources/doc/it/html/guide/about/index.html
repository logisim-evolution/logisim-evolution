        About the program Logisim-evolution
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Logisim</strong> Logisim is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. It has been originally created by <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Carl Burch</a> and actively developed until 2011. After this date the author focused on other projects, and recently the development has been officially stopped <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/retire-note.html" rel="nofollow">(see his message here)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, people from a group of swiss institutes(<a href="https://www.bfh.ch/fr/page_daccueil.html" rel="nofollow">Haute École Spécialisée Bernoise</a>,<a href="http://hepia.hesge.ch/" rel="nofollow">Haute École du paysage, d'ingénierie et d'architecture de Genève</a>,<a href="https://heig-vd.ch/" rel="nofollow">Haute École d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud</a>) started developing a version of Logisim that fitted their courses, integrating several tools -- for instance a chronogram, the possibility to test the schematics directly on an electronic board, TCL/TK consoles, ...
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is currently maintained by the <a href="http://reds.heig-vd.ch" rel="nofollow">REDS Institute</a>, which is part of the <a href="https://heig-vd.ch/" rel="nofollow">Haute École d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud</a>, Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have decided to release this new Logisim version under the name <strong>logisim-evolution</strong>, to highlight the large number of changes that occurred in these years, and we actively seek the contribution of the community.

        What's new in logisim-evolution
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chronogram -- to see the evolution of signals in your circuit
        </li>
        <li>Electronic board integration -- schematics can now be simulated on real hardware!
        </li>
        <li>Board editor -- to add new electronic boards
        </li>
        <li>VHDL component -- a new component type whose behavior is specified in VHDL le comportement est spécifié dans VHDL
        </li>
        <li>TCL/TK console -- interfaces between the circuit and the user
        </li>
        <li>DIP switches
        </li>
        <li>RGB LEDs
        </li>
        <li>Large number of bug-fixes

      <h2>
        Retro-compatibility
      </h2>We cannot assure retro-compatibility of logisim-evolution with files created with the original Logisim. We have incorporated a parser that alters the name of the components to satisfy VHDL requirements for variable names, but components evolved in shape since then (think, for instance, to RAM and counters). You might need to rework a bit your circuits when opening them with logisim-evolution -- but the changes will be stored in the new format, therefore you have to do your work only once.
      <h2>
        Wish-list
      </h2>
      <p>
        Logisim-evolution is a continuously-growing software, and we have several ideas we would like to implement. In particular, we would like to have:
      </p>unit tests for the code
      <ul>
        <li>extensive documentation
        </li>
        <li>test circuits
        </li>
        <li>... If you are willing to contribute with any of these, please feel free to contact us!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        How to get support for logisim-evolution
      </h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we do not have enough resources to provide direct support for logisim-evolution. We will, however, try to deal with the raised issues in a best-effort way.
