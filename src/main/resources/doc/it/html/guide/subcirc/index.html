      <p>
        As you build circuits that are more and more sophisticated, you will want to build smaller circuits that you can use multiple times as a module nested within larger circuits. In Logisim, such a smaller circuit that is used in a larger circuit is called a <strong>subcircuit</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're familiar with computer programming, you're familiar with the subprogram concept, whether it's called a <em>subroutine</em>, <em>function</em>, <em>method</em>, or <em>procedure</em> in your favored language. The subcircuit concept is analogous to this, and it serves the same purpose: To break a large job into bite-sized pieces, to save the effort of defining the same concept multiple times, and to facilitate debugging.
