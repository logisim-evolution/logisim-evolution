        Gate delays

      <p>
        As an example of the level of sophistication of Logisim's algorithm, consider the following circuit.
      </p>

      <p>
        This "obviously" always outputs 0. But NOT gates don't react instantaneously to their inputs in reality, and neither do they in Logisim. As a result, when this circuit's input changes from 0 to 1, the AND gate will briefly see two 1 inputs, and it will emit a 1 briefly. You won't see it on the screen. But the effect is observable when we use the AND gate's output as an input into the clock of a D flip-flop.
      </p>
      <p align="center">

      </p>
      <p>
        Poking the 0 input to become 1 leads to an instantaneous 1 going into the D flip-flop, and thus the flip-flop's value will toggle every time the circuit input goes from 0 to 1. The detailed sequence can also be observed thanks to the <a href="../tutorial/tutor-step.html">step-by-step</a> mode of the simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every component has a delay associated with it. More sophisticated components built into Logisim tend to have larger delays, but these delays are somewhat arbitrary and may not reflect reality.

        From a technical point of view, it is relatively easy to deal with this level of sophistication in a single circuit. Dealing with gate delays well across subcircuits, though, is a bit more complex; Logisim does attempt to address this correctly by placing all primitive component's propagation values into a single schedule regardless of the subcircuit in which the component lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Via the <a href="../opts/index.html">Project Options</a> window's <a href="../opts/opts-simulate.html">Simulation tab</a>, you can configure Logisim to add a random, occasional delay to a component's propagation. This is intended to simulate the unevenness of real circuits. In particular, an R-S latch built using two NOR gates will oscillate without this randomness, as both gates will process their inputs in lockstep. This randomness is disabled by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that I'm stopping short of saying that Logisim always addresses gate delays well. But at least it tries.
