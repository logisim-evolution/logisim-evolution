        About the program
      </h1>
      <p>
        Logisim is open-source software. The source code is included in the <code>src</code> subdirectory of the distributed JAR file.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find Logisim useful, please let me know. <em>Especially</em> do this if you are an educational institution; the information will help me in gaining support for the work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I welcome e-mails about Logisim, including bug reports, suggestions, and fixes. When you e-mail me, please remember that I have worked hard to produce Logisim without receiving any payment from you. If you want a right to complain about the software, then I would suggest shelling out the money for a competing program to Logisim. (I know of no open-source competitors that approach Logisim's feature set.) Nonetheless, I remain interested in continuing to improve Logisim, and your suggestions will be most welcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        The source code to Logisim is primarily my own work; I must acknowledge my employers who fund my work as a professor, including this program: I started the program at Saint John's University (Collegeville, Minnesota, USA) in 2000-2004, and I have continued it at Hendrix College (Conway, Arkansas, USA) from 2004 to present. I am very grateful to these colleges for giving me the time and resources to work on this project. If only all colleges and universities had their act as together and cared as much about excellent teaching as these colleges do!

        <li>Theldo Cruz Franqueira, Thanos Kakarountas, Ilia Lilov, Pablo Leal Ramos, and Uwe Zimmermann, who have contributed to translations packaged with Logisim. More information about the translations can be found on <a href="../prefs/pref-intl.html">International Preferences</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>The Spring 2005 CS61C class at the University of California, Berkeley, which endured the beta versions of Logisim 2.0. These students put up with <em>many</em> bugs, and I am <strong>very</strong> appreciative for their patience and for their suggestions!
        </li>
        <li>The Spring 2001 CSCI 150 classes at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University, which used the most rudimentary versions of Logisim as it was being developed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Several pieces of Logisim come from others' packages that Logisim uses; several of these pieces are distributed as part of Logisim.
