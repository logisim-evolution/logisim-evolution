<h1>Test Vector File Format</h1>

<p>Here is an example test vector file:</p>
<pre class="code">
# my test vector for add32
A[8]      B[8]      C[8]      Cin Cout
0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0   0
-2        0x05      3         0   0
0         0o3       3         0   0
</pre>

<p>First and foremost, the file format is simple. Headers match the circuit's input/output pins. Under that are the values to test against.</p>

<p>The first non-blank, non-comment line lists the name of each circuit input pin and its bit-width (if > 1), separated by whitespace.</p>

<p>One thing that often confuses people starting out is that the bit-width must be specified in the header any time it is not 1 bit.</p>
<p>NOTE: Bit width is not necessarily the same as the number of characters in the value. For example, a 4-bit value of 13 can be represented as 1101, 00001101, 0x0d, 0o15, 15, or 0b1101, etc.</p>

<p>Blank lines are ignored.  Anything following a '#' character is a
comment.  The first non-blank, non-comment line lists the name of each
circuit input pin and its width (if &gt; 1), separated by whitespace.
</p>

<p>The remaining lines list each value separated by whitespace. The
values can be in hex, octal, binary, or signed decimal. Hex values
must have a '0x' prefix. Octal values must have a '0o' prefix.
Binary and decimal are be
distinguished by the number of digits: binary values must always have
exactly as many digits as the width of the column; decimal values must
always have fewer, should not have leading zeros, and may have a
negative sign.</p>

<p>For improved readability, you can use underscores (<code>_</code>) anywhere
in numeric values. Underscores are ignored during parsing. Examples:
<code>0x0000_1111</code>, <code>0o1234_5670</code>, <code>1111_0000</code>,
<code>1_234</code>, or <code>-5_000</code>.</p>

<p>For hex, octal, and binary values, a digit of 'x' specifies four,
three, or one "don't care" bits. So the value 101xx is a five bit
binary value, with the last two bits unspecified, and 0x1ax5 is a hex
value with four unspecified bits.  Such "don't cares" can not be used
in decimal notation.</p>
