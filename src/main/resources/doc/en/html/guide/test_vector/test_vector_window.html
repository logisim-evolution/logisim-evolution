<h1>The Test Vector window</h1>

<p>The Test Vector window is similar to the Table tab of the Logging
window. You can load a test vector from a file, and Logisim will start
running tests on the current circuit. Like the logging window, there
is only one test vector window for the project, and the table will
change to reflect whichever circuit is being simulated in the project
window. Note, however, that the Test Vector module runs a separate
copy of the circuit simulator, and so does not interfere with, and is
not influenced by, the simulation in the project window.</p>

<p>For the example, we will test the circuit below. This circuit gives the results of five logic functions from two inputs. It contains an error because the bottom NAND gate should be an AND gate.</p>

<p align="center">
	<img class="notscal" src="../../../../img-guide/vector-test.png" alt="Example circuit with five logic functions">
</p>

<p>The test vector file looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<pre class="code">
A B O_Nor O_Nand O_Xor O_Or O_And O_AB[2]
0 0 1 1 0 0 0 00
0 1 0 1 1 1 0 01
1 0 0 1 1 1 0 10  
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 11  
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>To run the test, select the menu <b class="menu">|&nbsp; Simulate &nbsp;|</b>→<b class="menu">|&nbsp; Test vector &nbsp;|</b> then use the <b class="button">Load Vector</b> button. Select the vector file you built. The simulation is executed immediately and a table is displayed with the result.</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="../../../img-guide/vector-result.png" alt="Test Vector window showing results with errors flagged in red">
</p>

<p>Any incorrect outputs will be flagged in red. Hover the mouse over
the red box to see what the output should have been, according to the
test vector. Rows with incorrect outputs are sorted to the top of the
window.</p>

<p>The file format is simple. You can use the Logging module (with
"Include Header Line" selected in the file output tab) to get started,
since in most cases the Logging module outputs the same format as used
by the Test Vector module.</p>

<h2>Interactive Test Execution</h2>

<p>Each row in the Test Vector window has two buttons that allow you to manually interact with individual tests:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>"Show" button</b> (first column): This button previews the circuit state without checking outputs.
<ul>
<li><b>Combinational tests (seq=0)</b>: Resets the circuit, sets the input values, and propagates signals. 
Only the clicked row is highlighted in green to show it was executed.</li>
<li><b>Sequential tests (seq&gt;0)</b>: Resets the circuit, then runs all prior sequential steps in the set 
(from seq 1 up to the target step), propagating after each step. All executed sequential steps are highlighted 
in green to show the execution path. Combinational tests (seq=0) in the same set are not executed or highlighted.</li>
</ul>
The Show button does not verify outputs against expected values - it only shows what the circuit state would be.</li>

<li><b>"Set" button</b> (second column): This button sets input values and may execute tests.
<ul>
<li><b>Combinational tests (seq=0)</b>: Executes a full test - resets the circuit, applies the test inputs, 
verifies outputs against expected values, and updates the test results. Only the clicked row is highlighted 
in green to indicate it was executed.</li>
<li><b>Sequential tests (seq&gt;0)</b>: Does NOT reset the circuit and does NOT run any other tests. 
Simply sets the input values for that single step only, then propagates signals. Only the clicked row is 
highlighted in green. This allows you to manually step through a sequence by setting individual step values 
without resetting or running previous steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Highlighting behavior:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>When the Show button is clicked on a combinational test, only that single row is highlighted in green.</li>
<li>When the Show button is clicked on a sequential test, all sequential steps (seq &gt; 0) up to and including 
the target step are highlighted in green.</li>
<li>When the Set button is clicked, only the clicked row is highlighted in green, regardless of whether it's 
combinational or sequential.</li>
<li>Combinational tests (seq = 0) are never highlighted when executing sequential tests with the Show button, 
even if they're in the same set, because they are not executed.</li>
<li>Highlighting is cleared when a new vector file is loaded or when the circuit simulator is reset.</li>
</ul>
