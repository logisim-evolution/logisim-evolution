<h1>The Test Vector window</h1>

<p>The Test Vector window is similar to the Table tab of the Logging
window. You can load a test vector from a file, and Logisim will start
running tests on the current circuit. Like the logging window, there
is only one test vector window for the project, and the table will
change to reflect whichever circuit is being simulated in the project
window. Note, however, that the Test Vector module runs a separate
copy of the circuit simulator, and so does not interfere with, and is
not influenced by, the simulation in the project window.</p>

<p>For the example, we will test the circuit below. This circuit gives the results of five logic functions from two inputs. It contains an error because the bottom NAND gate should be an AND gate.</p>

</p>

<p>The test vector file looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<pre class="code">
A B O_Nor O_Nand O_Xor O_Or O_And O_AB[2]
0 0 1 1 0 0 0 00
0 1 0 1 1 1 0 01
1 0 0 1 1 1 0 10  
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 11  
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>To run the test, select the menu <b class="menu">|&nbsp; Simulate &nbsp;|</b>→<b class="menu">|&nbsp; Test vector &nbsp;|</b> then use the <b class="button">Load Vector</b> button. Select the vector file you built. The simulation is executed immediately and a table is displayed with the result.</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="../../../img-guide/vector-result.png" alt="Test Vector window showing results with errors flagged in red">
</p>

<p>Any incorrect outputs will be flagged in red. Hover the mouse over
the red box to see what the output should have been, according to the
test vector. Rows with incorrect outputs are sorted to the top of the
window.</p>

<p>The file format is simple. You can use the Logging module (with
"Include Header Line" selected in the file output tab) to get started,
since in most cases the Logging module outputs the same format as used
by the Test Vector module.</p>
