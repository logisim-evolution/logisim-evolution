        This tab includes preferences affecting the appearance of the main window used for Logisim.
      </p>
      <ul>
	  <li>
		  <p>
            <b>Reset window layout to logisims default settings</b> This button allows you to reset the appearance parameters to the default values of Logisim-Evolution.
          </p>
		</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Show tick rate:</b> If checked, then when ticks are enabled, Logisim displays a measurement of the rate at which it has been able to complete ticks. The tick rate is measured by averaging over the previous 1,000 ticks. (Disabling ticks or changing the maximum tick rate will clear its history.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This actual tick rate may be much less than the selected tick rate, because Logisim cannot simulate larger circuits at a very fast rate. For example, Logisim's maximum speed for a reasonably large circuit might be 16 Hz; you can select a faster tick rate, but the actual speed will not exceed 16 Hz.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Toolbar location:</b> This drop-down menu configures the location of the toolbar within the overall window. The toolbar may be placed on any of the window's four borders, described as north, south, east, and west. It may also be hidden, or it can be placed "down the middle" - that is, to the left of the canvas but to the right of the explorer pane and attribute table.
          </p>
        </li>
		<li>
          <p>
