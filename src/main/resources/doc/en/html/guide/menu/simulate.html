For example, a signal may end up entering a gate during one step, but the gate won't show a different signal until the next simulation step. To help identify which points in the overall circuit have changed, any points whose values change are indicated with a blue circle; if a subcircuit contains any points that have changed in it (or its subcircuits, recursively), then it will be drawn with a blue outline.

			Advances the clocks in the simulation by one tick when using the step-by-step mode. A clock set with a high/low duration of 1 tick will then advance by half a cycle.<br>  
			This can be useful when you want to advance the clocks manually, especially when the clock is not in the same circuit as the one you are currently viewing.

            Same function as before, but advances by two ticks. A clock set with a high/low duration of 1 tick will then advance one complete cycle.<br> The other clocks of the project advance simultaneously in proportion to their parameters.

            Allows you to select how often ticks occur. For example, 8 Hz means that ticks will occur eight times a second. A tick is the base unit of measurement for the speed of clocks.

            <b class=note>Note:</b> that the clock cycle speed will be slower than the tick speed: The fastest possible clock will have a one-tick up cycle and a one-tick down cycle; such a clock would have up/down cycle rate of 4 Hz if the ticks occur at 8 Hz.
