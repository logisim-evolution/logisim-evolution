    <h2>
      Behavior
    </h2>
    <p>
      A probe is an element that simply displays the value at a given point in a circuit. It does not itself interact with other components.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most respects, the probe component duplicates the functionality found in a <a href="../wiring/pin.html">Pin component</a> configured as an output pin. The primary difference is that if the circuit is used as a subcircuit component, then an output pin will be a part of that interface,
      whereas a probe is not. They also are different in that the probe does not have a Data Bits attribute to be configured: The bit width is inferred from whatever value it happens to see on its input. Graphically, they are similar but have slightly different borders: A pin has a thick, black
      border, whereas a probe has a thin, gray border.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Pins
    </h2>
    <p>
      A probe component has only one pin, which will acts as an input to the probe. The width that this pin accepts is adaptive: The probe will adapt to inputs of any width.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Attributes
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the component is selected or being added, the arrow keys alter its <q>Facing</q> attribute.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Facing
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The side of the component where its input pin should be.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Label
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The text within the label associated with the component.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Label Location
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The location of the label relative to the component.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Label Font
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The font with which to render the label.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Radix
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The base (for example, binary, decimal, or hexadecimal) in which a value is displayed.
      </dd>

    <h2>
