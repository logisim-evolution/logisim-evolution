    <h2>
      Behavior
    </h2>
    <p>
      A <q>tunnel</q> acts like a wire in that it binds points together, but unlike a wire the connection is not explicitly drawn. This is helpful when you need to connect points far apart in the circuit and a network of wires would make the circuit much more ugly. The below illustration
      illustrates how this works.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Here, all three tunnels have the same label, <em>a</em>, and so the three points to which the tunnels point are connected. (If one of the tunnels were labeled something else, like <em>b</em>, then it would be part of a different set of tunnels.) The controlled buffer at top emits a floating
      output since its lower input is 0. This normally leads the wire coming from the controlled buffer to be blue; but here it is dark green because the floating output combines through the tunnel with the 0 from the pin at bottom. If the control input into the buffer changes to 1, then the
      controlled buffer would feed 1 into the tunnel, which would combine with 0 from the pin at bottom to result in an error value; thus, we would then see red wires feeding through all three tunnels.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Pins
    </h2>
    <p>
      A tunnel has only one pin, whose bit width matches the tunnel's Data Bits attribute. This pin is neither an input nor an output â€” the matching tunnels are simply connected transparently.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Attributes
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the component is selected or being added, Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter its <q>Data Bits</q> attribute and the arrow keys alter its <q>Facing</q> attribute.
