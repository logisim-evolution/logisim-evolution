        Behavior
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Dual Port RAM component is a special memory component that behaves similarly to the RAM, storing up to 16,777,216 values (specified in the Address Bit Width attribute), each of which can include up to to 32 bits (specified in the Data Bit Width attribute).
        The key difference from the RAM memory component is that the Dual Port RAM, as its name implies, has 2 load ports and 1 write port, which allows the circuit to read 2 memory addresses and at the same time write to one memory address.
        The user can also modify individual values interactively via the Poke Tool, or alternatively modify the entire contents via the Menu Tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like the RAM component, the current values are displayed on it. Addresses displayed are listed in gray to the left of the display area. Inside, each value is listed using hexadecimal. The value at the currently selected address will be displayed in inverse text (white on black).
