      <h2>
        Minimal requirements for a successful simulation
      </h2>
      <p>
        To be able to perform a System On Chip (SOC) simulation you require to have in your sheet at least:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>One of the processors marked with the <img class="notscal" src="../../../../icons/up.png" alt="up">.
        </li>
        <li>One bus marked with the <img class="notscal" src="../../../../icons/socbus.png" alt="socbus">
        </li>
        <li>One memory simulator marked with the <img class="notscal" src="../../../../icons/socmem.png" alt="socmem">
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Furthermore, both the memory simulator and the processor need to be connected to the bus. This can be achieved by defining the <em><strong>Connected bus</strong></em> attribute of the respective components.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Restrictions
      </h2>
      <p>
        A SOC system can only be local on one sheet, meaning that a given bus component is only visible on the sheet it is placed. Building hierarchical systems is only possible when having the base system on one sheet and the extensions, for example VHDL-extentions or circuits, connected through the base system by means of input- and output pins.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Simulation speed
      </h2>
      <p>
        One has to realize that this library is intended to visualize what is going on in a SOC. Hence it provides in no way the means to perform (near) real-time simulations of your SOC. For this purpose more adequate systems are for example <a href="https://www.qemu.org" target="_blank">QEMU</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the test system with all parts of the system visible a maximum of 3 Hz tick-frequency was measured. Disabling some of the details for faster simulation improved the speed to 8 Hz. The best simulation speed can be achieved to use super-circuits with dynamic elements. Here the simulation speed went up to approx. 3kHz.
