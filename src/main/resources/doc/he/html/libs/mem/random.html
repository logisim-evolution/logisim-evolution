        Behavior
      </h2>
      <p>
        This component iterates through a pseudorandom sequence of numbers, which steps forward to the following number in the sequence each time the clock is triggered while the component is enabled. Technically speaking, the algorithm used to compute the pseudorandom sequence is a linear congruential generator: Starting from a seed <var>r</var><sub><small>0</small></sub>, the following number <var>r</var><sub><small>1</small></sub> is the number
      </p>
      <center>
        <var>r</var><sub><small>1</small></sub> = (25,214,903,917 <var>r</var><sub><small>0</small></sub> + 11) mod 2<sup><small>48</small></sup>
      </center>
      <p>
        The next value <var>r</var><sub><small>2</small></sub> is computed from <var>r</var><sub><small>1</small></sub> using the same computation, and so forth. This sequence is of 48-bit numbers; the value seen from the component is the low-order bits as configured by its Data Bits attribute, after first throwing out the lower 12 bits of the current seed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the clock input, the component also includes an <var>enable</var> input, which leads the clock input to be ignored when <var>enable</var> is 0, and the <var>reset</var> input, which resets the component's value asynchronously to the initial seed <var>r</var><sub><small>0</small></sub>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial seed is user-configurable. If it is configured at 0 (which is the default), then the seed is based on the current time; when instructed to reset through the <var>reset</var> input, the component computes a new seed based on the new current time.
      </p>

          Clock: At the instant that this is triggered as specified by the Trigger attribute, the component steps to the following number in its sequence.

          West edge, bottom pin (input, bit width 1)
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Enable: The component is enabled when this input is disconnected or 1; but if it is 0, then the clock input is ignored.

          South edge (input, bit width 1)
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Reset: When this is 1, the pseudorandom sequence asynchronously resets to the initial seed. (If seed is 0, this new seed should be different from the initial seed used previously.)
