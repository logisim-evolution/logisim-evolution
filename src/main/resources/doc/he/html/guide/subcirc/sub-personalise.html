    <h1>
        Customized appearance
    </h1>
    <p>
        The default appearance is very usable, and indeed Logisim existed for many years with no other option. If,
        however, you prefer that the subcircuit be drawn differently, you can select <b
            class=menu>|&nbsp;Project&nbsp;|</b>→<b class=menu>|&nbsp;Edit Circuit Appearance&nbsp;|</b> , and
        Logisim's interface will switch from its regular layout-editing interface to an interface for drawing the
        circuit's appearance. You can also click the far-right icon (<img alt="#########"
                                                                          class="icontxt"
                                                                          height=16 src="../../../../img-guide/projdesign.png" width=16>) in the
        explorer pane's upper toolbar.<br> Below, we are editing the 2:1 multiplexer's appearance so that it is drawn
        with the usual trapezoid rather than a rectangle.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img alt="#########" src="../../../img-guide/subcirc-5-custom-appear.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        With the appearance for the 2:1 multiplexer drawn as above, the layout for the 4:1 multiplexer would then appear
        as the following.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img alt="#########" src="../../../img-guide/subcirc-6-custom-layout.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        The appearance editor is like a traditional drawing program, but there are a few special symbols for indicating
        how the drawing works when placed into a circuit's layout. These special symbols cannot be removed.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The green circle with a line coming out of it, which we'll call the <b>anchor.</b> (<img alt="#########"
                                                                                                         class="icontxt"
                                                                                                         src="../../../../img-guide/anchor.png">)
                There is exactly one anchor in each subcircuit appearance. Each component in a circuit has a single
                point identifying its
                location; a user sees this when creating a new component: The mouse click identifies just a single
                location, and the component is placed relative to that (usually with the primary output at the mouse's
                location) The anchor identifies the mouse's location relative to the overall drawing
                when the subcircuit is created.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>anchor</b> also identifies the appearance's facing, as indicated by the direction the anchor's
                line points from its circle. When placing the subcircuit into a layout, the user can change the
                subcircuit's facing; the anchor's facing indicates in which direction the appearance is
                oriented. In our example, the anchor is facing east, and each instance of the subcircuit in the <b
                    class=reffig>Mux_4to1</b> is also facing east, so they are all drawn in the same orientation as the
                <b class=reffig>Mux_2to1</b> appearance.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The blue circles (<img alt="#########" class="icontxt" src="../../../../img-guide/pinoutput.png">) and
                squares with dots (<img alt="#########" class="icontxt" src="../../../../img-guide/pininput.png">) in
                them are the subcircuit's <q>ports.</q> There are exactly as many ports as there are
                input and output pins in the circuit. Ports corresponding to inputs are drawn as squares, while ports
                corresponding to outputs are drawn as circles. Each port indicates how a wire connecting into the
                circuit will correspond to an input or output pin within the layout.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you select a port, Logisim will indicate the corresponding pin by popping up a miniature diagram of the
        layout in the window's bottom right corner, with the corresponding pin(s) drawn in blue. This does not happen
        when all ports are selected.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img alt="#########" src="../../../img-guide/subcirc-7-custom-layout.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        We can change the zoom of the image with a <b class="tkeybd">Ctrl+Mouse Wheel</b> or by using the magnifying
        glass buttons or the slider at the bottom left of the workspace. The rate is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The toolbar contains tools for adding additional shapes, as shown below. Some keys (<b class="tkeybd">Ctrl,Alt,Shift</b>)
        have an effect on the way shapes are drawn. These keys can be combined with each other.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <b class="tkeybd">Ctrl</b>: Aligns the end points on the grid.<br>
        <b class="tkeybd">Shift</b>: Orient the lines at an angle multiple of 45° or make the figures symmetrical
        (Square, Rounded Square, Circle).<br>
        <b class="tkeybd">Alt</b>: Draws the figures from their centre.
