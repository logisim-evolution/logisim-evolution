        This format is a raw binary image of the memory data in a file. There are no headers, no comments, no coding. The file is probably not editable in a common text editor.<br>
        In the big-endian mode the memory is considered as a sequence of bytes regardless of the size of its words, with left to right the high bytes and then the low bytes. Illustrations can be found in <a href="mem-v3byte.html#little">v3.0 hex bytes addressed big-endian</a>
      </p>

        Binary data little-endian
      </h1>
      <p>
        This format is identical to the previous one with the same characteristics.<br>
        In the little-endian mode, the memory is considered as a sequence of bytes with from right to left the least significant bits and then the most significant bits. Illustrations can be found in <a href="mem-v3byte.html#little">v3.0 hex bytes addressed little-endian</a>
