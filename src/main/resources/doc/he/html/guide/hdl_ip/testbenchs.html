    <h1>Simulating test benchs</h1>

    <p>You can add a test bench to your circuit to test it, but you have to
        consider the following restrictions due to the simulation
        architecture.
    </p>

    <p align="center"><img src="../../../../img-guide/hdl-ip-tb.png"/></p>

    <h2>Simulation must be driven by Logisim</h2>

    <p>You cannot add event generating elements to your test bench, for
        example, you cannot add a clock generator process. Your test bench
        must take an external clock from Logisim as input.
    </p>

    <h2>Don't use time based conditions</h2>

    <p>The time representation does not exist in Logisim, no you cannot have
        event based on time, for example <i>wait for 5 ns</i>. If you want to
        make asynchronous verification, you must add a <i>sysclk</i> who has
        at least twice the frequency of the mainclk. This way, you will be
        able to check the signals not only on the main clock rising edges but
        at any time you need.
