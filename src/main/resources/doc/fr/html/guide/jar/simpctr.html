        Simple Gray Code Counter
      </h1>
      <p>
        Often we want components that aren't exclusively combinational in nature - that is, we want the component to have some memory. There is an important subtlety in defining such components: You can't have the component itself store the state, because an individual component can appear many times in the same circuit. It can't appear directly within a circuit multiple times, but it can appear multiple times if it appears in a subcircuit that is used several times.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is to create a new class for representing the object's current state, and to associate instances of this with the component through the parent circuit's state. In this example, which implements an edge-triggered 4-bit Gray code counter, we define a <code>CounterData</code> class to represent the counter's state, in addition to the <code>InstanceFactory</code> subclass as illustrated previously. The <code>CounterData</code> object remembers both the counter's current value, as well as the last clock input seen (to detect rising edges).
