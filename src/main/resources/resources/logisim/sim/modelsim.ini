; VITAL concerns:
;
; The library ieee contains (among other packages) the packages of the
; VITAL 2000 standard.  When a design uses VITAL 2000 exclusively, it should use
; the physical library ieee (recommended), or use the physical library
; vital2000, but not both.  The design can use logical library ieee and/or
; vital2000 as long as each of these maps to the same physical library, either
; ieee or vital2000.
;
; A design using the 1995 version of the VITAL packages, whether or not
; it also uses the 2000 version of the VITAL packages, must have logical library
; name ieee mapped to physical library vital1995.  (A design cannot use library
; vital1995 directly because some packages in this library use logical name ieee
; when referring to the other packages in the library.)  The design source
; should use logical name ieee when referring to any packages there except the
; VITAL 2000 packages.  Any VITAL 2000 present in the design must use logical
; name vital2000 (mapped to physical library vital2000) to refer to those
; packages.
; ieee = $MODEL_TECH/../vital1995
;
; For compatiblity with previous releases, logical library name vital2000 maps
; to library vital2000 (a different library than library ieee, containing the
; same packages).
; A design should not reference VITAL from both the ieee library and the
; vital2000 library because the vital packages are effectively different.
; A design that references both the ieee and vital2000 libraries must have
; both logical names ieee and vital2000 mapped to the same library, either of
; these:
